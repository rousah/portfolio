  "description": "Hola! My name is Rosa, I am a Software Developer. A couple years ago I graduated from the Universitat Politècnica de València (Spain) in Interactive Technologies Engineering, and ever since then I've been working as a Frontend Developer at The Selection Lab in Amsterdam. I've been in the startup world for 3 years and because of that, apart from my main focus in frontend web development, I've picked up a lot of other skills and learnings as well.\n\nI am mainly attracted to web, app and game development, with a special focus on creating attractive and fun UI's. I love working in teams in an agile environment.\n\nI am not a coffee drinker, but a tea lover. I really like being active, I practice yoga and modern dance on a weekly basis, among others.\n\nAs a third-culture-kid, growing up in a different country than my parents did, I am very internationally oriented. I speak Spanish, English and Dutch natively, I really like travelling and visiting my friends all over the world.\n\nI think that's enough about me! Would you like to tell me about you?"
